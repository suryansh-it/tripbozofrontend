## Key Features

### For Travelers

#### 1. Country-Specific App Discovery

**Purpose & Use Case**
When traveling to a new country, travelers face the challenge of discovering which apps actually work there and solve real travel problems. This feature eliminates that research burden by providing **country-curated app lists** that are pre-vetted and organized by use case.

**What It Does**
- Browse travel apps specifically curated and tested for each destination country
- Filter apps by category (Navigation, Communication, Finance, Maps, Translation, Accommodation, Food, etc.)
- View comprehensive app details:
  - App description and functionality overview
  - User ratings and community reviews
  - Download links for iOS, Android, and Web versions
  - Affiliate tracking links (for monetization)
  - Screenshots showing the app interface
- Check critical app capabilities:
  - **Offline Support**: Works without internet (critical for remote areas)
  - **Foreign Card Support**: Accepts international credit cards (payment in local currency)
  - **Sponsored Badge**: Indicates promoted/affiliate apps
- Read and write community reviews with ratings (1-5 stars)
- Search and filter functionality for quick discovery

**Business Logic**
```
User Flow:
1. User navigates to country page (/country/{country_code}/)
2. System fetches cached country data (1-hour TTL)
3. Apps grouped by category (Navigation, Communication, etc.)
4. Each app shows: icon, name, rating, description, download options
5. User can click app to see full details and reviews
6. User can add app to their personal bundle
```

**Why It Matters**
- **Time Saving**: Instead of searching app stores, users get curated recommendations
- **Quality Assurance**: Apps are vetted by the platform (admin-approved)
- **Accessibility**: Solves the problem of app store language barriers in foreign countries
- **Monetization**: Affiliate links generate revenue when users download

#### 2. Essentials Hub

**Purpose & Use Case**
Travelers often need critical information like emergency contacts, local phrases, and cultural tips before arrival. This feature consolidates all essential travel information in one place, reducing anxiety and preventing costly mistakes.

**What It Does**

**Emergency Contacts Section**
- Display embassy and consulate contact information for each country
- Include emergency services (police, ambulance, fire)
- Medical facility information and pharmacy contacts
- All information includes phone numbers, emails, and addresses

**Local Phrases Section**
- Common phrases in the local language with English translations
- Context notes explaining when/how to use each phrase
- Examples: greetings, "Where is the bathroom?", "How much does this cost?"
- Helps travelers communicate in emergency or essential situations

**Travel Tips Section**
- Cultural etiquette and customs (e.g., tipping practices, social norms)
- Transportation advice (public transit, taxi, rideshare reliability)
- Safety information and areas to avoid
- Cost of living and budgeting tips
- Local customs and traditions

**Origin Assistance Section**
- Information from traveler's home country's embassy
- Resources for travelers from that country
- Links to mission finder and consular services
- Emergency phone numbers for citizens abroad

**Business Logic**
```
Data Flow:
1. Admin populates EmergencyContact, LocalPhrase, UsefulTip models
2. System caches essentials data (2-hour TTL)
3. User requests /country/{code}/essentials/
4. API returns all essentials for that country
5. Frontend displays in organized sections
```

**Why It Matters**
- **Safety**: Travelers can prepare for emergencies before they happen
- **Confidence**: Having essential phrases reduces language anxiety
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understanding customs prevents offensive mistakes
- **Reduced Stress**: One-stop resource for all critical information

#### 3. Itinerary & Smart Suggestions

**Purpose & Use Case**
Multi-country travelers need different apps for different environments (beaches need different apps than mountains). This feature learns about the trip structure and recommends relevant apps automatically.

**What It Does**

**Itinerary Creation**
- Create multi-stop trips with specific locations
- Assign each stop a type: Beach, Mountain, City, Desert, Ski Resort, etc.
- Order stops chronologically
- Store complete trip plan in database

**Intelligent Suggestions**
- System analyzes each stop type in the itinerary
- Looks up LegSuggestionRule: "For beach stops, suggest Navigation, Communication, Finance apps"
- Returns ranked apps from those categories for that country
- Suggestions adapt as user adds/removes stops

**Smart Recommendation Algorithm**
```
For a beach stop in Thailand:
1. Find LegSuggestionRule where stop_type = 'beach'
2. Get associated categories: Navigation, Finance, Communication
3. Fetch apps from Thailand in those categories
4. Rank by rating (highest first)
5. Return top apps with descriptions

For a mountain stop in Nepal:
1. Find LegSuggestionRule where stop_type = 'mountain'
2. Get associated categories: Navigation, Offline Maps, Emergency
3. Fetch apps from Nepal in those categories
4. Filter for offline-capable apps (critical for mountains)
5. Return ranked results
```

**Business Logic**
- Stop types are predefined: beach, mountain, city, desert, ski
- Admin manages LegSuggestionRule to map stop_type → app categories
- Recommendations change dynamically as itinerary changes
- Users can modify itinerary and get updated suggestions

**Why It Matters**
- **Personalization**: Each trip is unique; suggestions match trip context
- **Efficiency**: Users don't waste time downloading wrong apps
- **Optimization**: Recommends appropriate app categories for environment
- **Preparation**: Ensures users have right tools for each location

#### 4. App Bundles & Sharing

**Purpose & Use Case**
Travelers often want to share their app research with friends or travel groups. This feature makes sharing app collections seamless and instant through QR codes and shareable links.

**What It Does**

**Bundle Creation**
- User selects multiple apps from various countries
- Creates a named bundle (e.g., "Europe Trip 2026", "Digital Nomad Essentials")
- System generates unique bundle ID and stores in database
- Associates bundle with user account

**QR Code Generation**
- Each bundle gets a unique QR code containing the bundle ID
- QR code can be printed, emailed, or shared on social media
- When scanned, QR code directs to bundle redirect page
- Mobile-friendly interface shows all apps in bundle with download links

**Shareable Links**
- Direct URL format: `https://tripbozo.vercel.app/bundle-redirect/{bundle_id}`
- Link can be shared via email, messaging, social media
- Anyone with link can view bundle without authentication
- Includes one-click navigation to app store download links

**Analytics Tracking**
- System tracks how many people viewed the bundle
- Monitors which apps were downloaded from bundle
- Provides sharing analytics to creator

**Business Logic**
```
Bundle Flow:
1. User selects apps → clicks "Add to Bundle"
2. System creates Bundle record if new
3. Associates selected apps with bundle
4. Generates unique bundle_id
5. Creates QR code with embedded bundle_id
6. User shares QR/link with friends
7. Recipients scan/click → Redirect page
8. Page shows all apps with download buttons
```

**Why It Matters**
- **Social Sharing**: Enables word-of-mouth discovery
- **Group Travel**: Families/groups can synchronize app selections
- **Content Creator Value**: Influencers can package travel guides
- **Monetization**: Tracks affiliate clicks and conversions through bundles

#### 5. Personalization

**Purpose & Use Case**
Travelers have different home countries with different embassy services and currency. Personalization adapts the app experience to each user's unique background and travel needs.

**What It Does**

**Origin Country Preference**
- User sets their home country during onboarding
- System stores this as UserOriginPreference
- Used to customize:
  - **Origin Assistance Section**: Shows their home country's embassy resources
  - **Recommendations**: Tailors suggestions based on traveler profile
  - **Currency Display**: Can show prices in home country currency
  - **Language Hints**: Provides phrases relevant to their native language

**Personalized App Lists**
- System can create "My Favorite Apps" collections
- Stores user's app preferences (which apps they marked as useful)
- Recommendations factor in what similar users found helpful
- Over time, recommendations improve (collaborative filtering potential)

**Travel History Tracking**
- System tracks countries user has visited
- Can show "Most Popular in Countries You've Visited"
- Enables "You might also need" recommendations
- Builds user travel profile

**Business Logic**
```
Personalization Flow:
1. New user signs up → OnboardingComponent
2. User selects origin country
3. System stores in UserOriginPreference
4. When user views any country page:
   - Load user's origin_country
   - If origin_country != current_country:
     - Show "Origin Assistance" section with their home country resources
   - Show personalized recommendations
   - Track as visited country
```

**Why It Matters**
- **Relevance**: Users see content specific to their situation
- **Efficiency**: Reduces information overload with personalized suggestions
- **Convenience**: Home country resources always accessible
- **Engagement**: Personalization increases app usage and stickiness

#### 6. User Account Management

**Purpose & Use Case**
Users need secure access to their data with flexible authentication options. This feature provides multiple sign-in methods, profile management, and complete data control.

**What It Does**

**Registration & Email/Password Login**
- Traditional email/password registration
- Password hashing using Django's bcrypt
- Email verification (optional, can be enabled)
- Password reset flow with email link
- Session management with JWT tokens

**Social Sign-In (Google & Facebook)**
- **Google OAuth**: Single-click login with Google account
  - No password to remember
  - Automatic user profile population (email, name, profile picture)
  - Secure token-based authentication
  
- **Facebook OAuth**: Single-click login with Facebook
  - Fast account creation
  - Access to Facebook friends (future feature)
  - Instant profile setup

**Profile Management**

**Account Deletion (GDPR Compliant)**
- One-click account deletion
- Permanently removes all user data:
  - Personal information
  - Saved preferences
  - Bundles
  - Itineraries
  - Review history
- Cannot be recovered after deletion
- Generates deletion confirmation email

**Security Features**
- JWT token-based authentication (no session cookies)
- Access tokens (15-minute expiration)
- Refresh tokens (7-day expiration)
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Logout clears tokens from frontend

**Business Logic**
```
Authentication Flow:
1. User signs up / logs in
2. Credentials verified against User model
3. System generates JWT (access + refresh tokens)
4. Frontend stores access token in localStorage
5. All API requests include token in Authorization header
6. Token expires after 15 minutes
7. Frontend automatically refreshes token using refresh token
8. User remains logged in until refresh token expires (7 days)

Social Login Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup appears
3. User grants permission
4. Frontend receives Google access token
5. Frontend sends token to /auth/social/google/
6. Backend verifies token with Google servers
7. Backend extracts user info (email, name)
8. Backend creates/updates User if doesn't exist
9. Backend generates JWT and returns to frontend
10. Frontend stores JWT and redirects to homepage
```

**Why It Matters**
- **User Trust**: Multiple sign-in options increase accessibility
- **Convenience**: Social login faster than email/password
- **Security**: JWT tokens are more secure than cookies

---

### Endpoint Categories

#### **Authentication & User Management**

##### 1. User Registration
```
POST /api/auth/registration/
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Not required (public endpoint)

Request Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "traveluser123",
  "password1": "SecurePassword123!",
  "password2": "SecurePassword123!"
}

Response: 201 Created
{
  "key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 42,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "traveluser123"
  }
}

Error Response: 400 Bad Request
{
  "email": ["User with this email already exists."],
  "password1": ["Password must be at least 8 characters."],
  "password2": ["Passwords do not match."]
}
```

**Purpose**
- Enables new users to create accounts with email/password
- Validates email uniqueness and password strength
- Automatically generates JWT token for immediate login
- Returns access token so user doesn't need to login separately

**Business Logic**
1. Check if email already exists → Error if duplicate
2. Validate password meets security requirements (length, complexity)
3. Hash password using bcrypt before storing
4. Create User record in database
5. Generate JWT access token
6. Return token so user is immediately authenticated

**Real-World Scenario**
```
User: "I want to sign up for Tripbozo to plan my Thailand trip"
Flow: 
1. User enters email, password, and username
2. System validates all requirements
3. System creates account and returns JWT token
4. User is immediately logged in, can access preferences
5. User can set origin country and start exploring apps
```

---

##### 2. Email/Password Login
```
POST /api/auth/login/
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Not required (public endpoint)

Request Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 42,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "traveluser123"
  }
}

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "non_field_errors": ["Wrong email, username, or password."]
}
```

**Purpose**
- Allows existing users to log back into their accounts
- Returns JWT token for authenticated API access
- Supports email or username as login identifier

**Business Logic**
1. Look up User by email or username
2. Compare provided password with hashed password in database
3. If match → Generate JWT token and return
4. If no match → Return 401 Unauthorized (don't reveal if email exists)
5. Token valid for 15 minutes, can be refreshed

**Security Considerations**
- Password never stored or returned in response
- 401 error message intentionally vague (prevents username enumeration)
- Should implement rate limiting (5 attempts per hour per IP)
- Consider adding "Remember me" functionality (longer refresh token)

---

##### 3. Google OAuth Login
```
POST /api/auth/social/google/
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Not required (public endpoint)

Request Body:
{
  "access_token": "ya29.a0AfH6SMBx..."
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 42,
    "email": "user@gmail.com",
    "username": "user-google-123",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }
}

Error Response: 400 Bad Request
{
  "detail": "Google access token is required."
}

Error Response: 502 Bad Gateway
{
  "detail": "Google sign-in was not accepted. Please try again."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Enables seamless "Sign in with Google" functionality
- Creates account automatically if user doesn't exist
- Links Google identity to Tripbozo account
- No password required (Google manages authentication)

**Business Logic**
```
Google OAuth Flow:
1. Frontend displays Google sign-in button (OAuth consent screen)
2. User clicks button, authenticates with Google
3. Google returns access_token to frontend
4. Frontend sends access_token to /auth/social/google/
5. Backend validates token with Google's token endpoint
6. Google returns user info (email, first_name, last_name, picture)
7. Backend checks if User with that email exists
   - If exists: Link Google to existing account
   - If new: Create new User account with Google info
8. Backend generates Tripbozo JWT token
9. Frontend stores JWT and redirects to homepage

Token Validation:
POST https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

Response includes:
{
  "sub": "google_user_id",
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "given_name": "John",
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "picture": "https://..."
}
```

**Real-World Scenario**
```
User: "I want to sign in to Tripbozo using my Google account"
Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth consent popup appears
3. User selects their Google account
4. Google redirects back with access_token
5. Frontend sends token to /auth/social/google/
6. System creates account if first time, returns JWT
7. User is now logged in to Tripbozo with same email as Google
8. User's name/profile automatically populated from Google
```

**Advantages**
- **User Convenience**: One-click login, no password to remember
- **Auto Population**: User profile data comes from Google
- **Account Linking**: User can later add password login to same account
- **Security**: Google handles password security

##### 4. Facebook OAuth Login
```
POST /api/auth/social/facebook/
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Not required (public endpoint)

Request Body:
{
  "access_token": "EAAFl4xW..."
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "key": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 42,
    "email": "user@facebook.com",
    "username": "user-facebook-456",
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Smith"
  }
}

Error Response: 400 Bad Request
{
  "detail": "Facebook access token is required."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Enables "Sign in with Facebook" functionality
- Provides alternative authentication for users with Facebook accounts
- Similar to Google OAuth but using Facebook identity

**Business Logic**
- Same as Google OAuth but:
  - Validates token with Facebook's Graph API
  - Extracts user info from Facebook profile
  - Creates Tripbozo account linked to Facebook identity

**Implementation Details**
- Uses django-allauth library for OAuth handling
- Supports account linking (user can have both Google and Facebook)
- Profile picture pulled from Facebook if available

---

##### 5. JWT Token Refresh
```
POST /api/auth/jwt/refresh/
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Not required (uses refresh token from request body)

Request Body:
{
  "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "detail": "Token is invalid or expired"
}
```

**Purpose**
- Extends user session without requiring re-authentication
- Issues new access token when current one expires
- Keeps refresh token valid until its own expiration (7 days)

**Business Logic**
```
Token Lifecycle:
1. User logs in → Receives access_token (15 min) + refresh_token (7 days)
2. After 15 minutes, access_token expires
3. Frontend automatically calls /jwt/refresh/ with refresh_token
4. Backend validates refresh_token is not expired
5. Backend issues new access_token (another 15 min)
6. Frontend updates stored access_token
7. User stays logged in without re-entering password

After 7 days:
- Refresh token expires
- User must log in again
- This forces security check every week
```

**Automatic Refresh Pattern (Frontend)**
```javascript
// api.js axios interceptor
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  response => response,
  async error => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Access token expired
      const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refreshToken');
      const response = await axios.post('/auth/jwt/refresh/', {
        refresh: refreshToken
      });
      // Store new access token
      localStorage.setItem('accessToken', response.data.access);
      // Retry original request with new token
      return apiClient(error.config);
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

---

##### 6. Get User Details
```
GET /api/auth/user/
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Authentication: Required (token in header)

Response: 200 OK
{
  "id": 42,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "traveluser123",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "is_active": true,
  "date_joined": "2026-02-15T08:30:00Z"
}

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Allows frontend to fetch current logged-in user's profile
- Used to populate user profile UI
- Verify user is still authenticated
- Display user info in navbar/profile sections

**Business Logic**
1. Extract JWT token from Authorization header
2. Validate token signature and expiration
3. Look up User ID from token payload
4. Return User object with public fields
5. Hide sensitive data (password_hash, etc.)

**Real-World Usage**
```javascript
// Frontend - AuthInitializer.jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  if (token) {
    // Verify token is still valid
    apiClient.get('/auth/user/')
      .then(response => {
        // User is authenticated
        setUser(response.data);
        setIsLoggedIn(true);
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // Token invalid or expired, clear localStorage
        localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
        setIsLoggedIn(false);
      });
  }
}, []);
```

---

##### 7. Delete User Account
```
DELETE /api/auth/user/delete/
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Authentication: Required (token in header)

Response: 204 No Content
(No response body returned)

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Allows users to permanently delete their account
- Implements GDPR right-to-be-forgotten
- Complete data removal for privacy compliance
- Irreversible action for user autonomy

**Business Logic - What Gets Deleted**
```
When user calls DELETE /auth/user/delete/:
1. Delete User record (email, username, password)
2. Delete UserOriginPreference (origin country)
3. Delete all Bundles created by user
4. Delete all Itineraries created by user
5. Delete all Reviews written by user
6. Delete any saved preferences
7. Blacklist refresh token (prevent reuse)
8. Send confirmation email to user
9. Return 204 No Content
```

**Security Considerations**
- Cannot be undone (no recovery option)
- Confirmation email sent to account email
- Should implement confirmation flow (email verification)
- Future: Add confirmation dialog on frontend

**Real-World Scenario**
```
User: "I want to permanently delete my Tripbozo account"
Flow:
1. User navigates to Settings → Delete Account
2. System shows warning: "This cannot be undone"
3. User confirms deletion
4. Frontend sends DELETE request with auth token
5. Backend marks all user data for deletion
6. Backend clears authentication tokens
7. Confirmation email sent to user
8. Frontend redirects to homepage (logged out)
```

}

Error Response: 404 Not Found
{
  "detail": "Country with code 'XX' not found."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Single comprehensive endpoint providing all data needed for country page
- Eliminates multiple API calls, improves performance
- Combines: country info, apps, categories, essentials, emergency contacts
- Cached heavily (1 hour TTL) to reduce database load

**Business Logic**
```
Request Flow:
1. Frontend requests /country/TH/
2. Backend checks Redis cache for "country_TH"
3. If cached and fresh: Return cached data immediately
4. If not cached or stale:
   - Query Country model for "TH"
   - Fetch all AppCategory for this country
   - For each category, fetch all TravelApps
   - Fetch EmergencyContact records
   - Fetch LocalPhrase records
   - Fetch UsefulTip records
   - If authenticated: Fetch OriginCountryAssistance for user's origin
   - Combine into response object
   - Cache for 1 hour
   - Return to frontend

Cache Key: f"country_{country_code}"
TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
```

**Real-World Usage**
```
User lands on homepage:
1. User sees "Thailand" in featured countries
2. User clicks on Thailand card
3. Frontend navigates to /country/TH
4. Frontend calls GET /country/TH/
5. API returns complete country data in ONE request
6. UI renders country page with all apps, categories, essentials
7. User can immediately browse apps, read tips, etc.

Performance Impact:
- Without caching: 6+ database queries per request
- With caching: Redis lookup (1ms) instead of database queries (100-500ms)
- At scale (1000 requests/min): Reduces database load by ~95%
```

**Why This Endpoint**
- **Performance**: Caching reduces load on database
- **User Experience**: Single request provides complete data
- **Flexibility**: Frontend gets data in expected structure
- **Monetization**: Tracks page views and engagement

1. Query TravelApp model with filters:
   - country__code = country_code
   - If category param: category__name = category
   - If works_offline: works_offline = true
   - If rating_min: rating >= rating_min
2. Order by rating (descending)
3. Paginate results (default 20 per page)
4. Return app list
```

**Use Cases**
```
// Filter apps by capability
GET /api/country/TH/apps/?works_offline=true
Response: [
  Google Maps, Maps.ME, OsmAnd, ...
] // Only offline-capable apps

// Find apps in specific category
GET /api/country/TH/apps/?category=Communication

- Builds trust through community insights

**Business Logic**
```
1. Fetch TravelApp by country_code + app_id
2. Aggregate Review records:
   - Calculate average rating
   - Count total reviews
   - Distribution of 1-5 stars
3. Extract key features from app metadata
4. Fetch top reviews (sorted by rating, then date)
5. Return comprehensive insights object
```

**Decision-Making Flow**
```
User sees Google Maps and Maps.ME in results:
1. User clicks on Google Maps to see details
2. Calls /country/TH/apps/101/insights/
3. Sees: 4.7 rating, 2341 reviews
4. Reads: "Works offline: Yes"
5. Reads top reviews: "Saved money on data charges"
6. User downloads Google Maps with confidence
```

#### **User Preferences & Personalization**

##### 1. Get User Origin Country Preference
```
GET /api/auth/user/origin-country/
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Authentication: Required

Response: 200 OK
{
  "user_id": 42,
  "origin_country": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "United States",
    "code": "US",
    "flag": "https://..."
  },
  "preference_set_date": "2026-02-15T08:30:00Z"
}

Response (if not set): 200 OK
{
  "user_id": 42,
  "origin_country": null,
  "preference_set_date": null
}

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Retrieves user's selected origin country
- Used to customize essentials and resources shown
- Part of user personalization system
- Shows when preference was last updated

**Business Logic**
```
1. Extract user ID from JWT token
2. Query UserOriginPreference for this user
3. If exists: Return origin_country relation
4. If not exists: Return null (user hasn't set preference yet)
5. Include timestamp of when preference was set
```

**Usage Flow**
```
Frontend loads:
1. AuthInitializer.jsx calls GET /auth/user/
2. If authenticated, also calls GET /auth/user/origin-country/
3. Stores origin_country in context
4. When user visits any country page:
   - If origin_country != current_country:
     - Show "Origin Assistance" section with their home country embassy resources
```

---

##### 2. Update User Origin Country Preference
```
PATCH /api/auth/user/origin-country/
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json
Authentication: Required

Request Body:
{
  "origin_country_code": "US"
}

Response: 200 OK
{
  "user_id": 42,
  "origin_country": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "United States",
    "code": "US",
    "flag": "https://..."
  },
  "preference_set_date": "2026-04-24T10:30:00Z"
}

Error Response: 404 Not Found
{
  "detail": "Country with code 'XX' not found"
}

Error Response: 401 Unauthorized
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

**Purpose**
- Allows users to set/update their origin country
- Used during onboarding and profile settings
- Triggers personalization system
- Updates timestamp for tracking

**Business Logic**
```
1. Extract user_id from JWT token
2. Validate country_code exists in Country model
3. Create or update UserOriginPreference:
   - Look up existing preference for user
   - If exists: Update origin_country to new country
   - If doesn't exist: Create new preference
4. Set updated_at timestamp to current time
5. Return updated preference with new country
```

**Onboarding Flow**
```
New user completes signup:
1. User is redirected to Onboarding page
2. User sees dropdown: "Where are you from?"
3. User selects "United States"
4. Frontend sends PATCH /auth/user/origin-country/
   {
     "origin_country_code": "US"
   }
5. Backend creates UserOriginPreference
6. User is redirected to homepage
7. Now all country pages show "US Assistance" section
```

**Profile Update Flow**
```
Existing user moves to new country:
1. User goes to Settings/Profile
2. Changes origin country from "US" to "UK"
3. Frontend sends PATCH request
4. Backend updates existing preference
5. Next time user views any country page:
   - Shows UK embassy resources instead of US
```

Error Response: 400 Bad Request
{
  "name": ["This field may not be blank."],
  "stops": ["At least one stop is required."]
}
```

**Purpose**
- Creates multi-stop trip plans
- Foundation for smart app recommendations
- Stores user's travel structure
- Enables personalized suggestions based on trip

**Business Logic**
```
1. Extract user_id from JWT token
2. Validate request data:
   - Itinerary name not empty
   - At least one stop provided
   - All stops have name, stop_type, order
   - stop_type is valid (beach, mountain, city, etc.)
3. Create Itinerary record for user
4. Create Stop records for each stop
5. Validate orders are sequential
6. For each stop, count potential app suggestions:
   - Look up LegSuggestionRule for stop_type
   - Count TravelApps in matched categories
7. Return created itinerary with stops
```

**Real-World Scenario**
```
User planning 4-week USA trip:
1. User selects Itinerary from menu
2. Enters trip name: "Summer 2026"
3. Adds stops:
   - Stop 1: Los Angeles (city)
   - Stop 2: Yosemite (mountain)
   - Stop 3: Lake Tahoe (ski resort)
   - Stop 4: San Francisco (city)
4. System returns itinerary with stop suggestions
5. User can see how many relevant apps exist for each stop
6. User clicks each stop to see specific recommendations

}

Error Response: 404 Not Found
{
  "detail": "Itinerary or leg not found"
}
```

**Purpose**
- Provides smart app recommendations based on stop type
- Only suggests apps relevant to specific environment
- Helps users prepare with right tools for each location
- Matches stop type to app categories intelligently

**Business Logic**
```
Recommendation Algorithm:
1. Get Stop record by leg_id
2. Extract stop_type (mountain, beach, city, etc.)
3. Query LegSuggestionRule where stop_type = 'mountain'
4. Get all associated app categories from rule
5. For each category, fetch TravelApps:
   - country_code matches trip destination
   - category in matched categories
   - ordered by rating (highest first)
6. Return top apps for each category
7. Include offline/foreign card capability flags

Example for mountain stop:
- stop_type: "mountain"
- LegSuggestionRule says:
  {
    "stop_type": "mountain",
    "categories": ["Navigation", "Photography", "Emergency"]
  }
- Fetch apps for these categories in destination country
- Result: hiking maps, trail apps, camera apps, emergency apps
```

**Smart Personalization**
```
Mountain stop in Yosemite:
✓ AllTrails - hiking specific
✓ Maps.ME - offline maps essential here
✓ Camera+ - photography important for scenery
✓ Emergency SOS - remote area safety
✗ Uber - unlikely to need here
✗ Restaurant apps - limited options in park

City stop in San Francisco:
✓ Google Maps - navigation in dense urban
✓ Uber/Lyft - transportation essential
✓ Restaurant apps - many dining options
✓ Museum apps - cultural attractions
✗ Hiking apps - not relevant
✗ Offline maps - always connected in city
```

## Error Handling & Rate Limiting

### Common Error Responses

#### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "email": ["User with this email already exists."],
  "password": ["Password too short."]
}
```

#### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

#### 429 Too Many Requests
```json
{
  "detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 60 seconds."
}
```

### Recommended Rate Limits

```
- Login endpoint: 5 requests per hour per IP
- Registration: 3 requests per hour per IP
- General API: 100 requests per hour per user
- Public endpoints: 1000 requests per hour per IP
```

---

## Caching Strategy

### Cache TTLs (Time To Live)

```python
CACHE_TTLS = {
    "country_page": 3600,        # 1 hour
    "app_list": 900,             # 15 minutes
    "essentials": 7200,          # 2 hours
    "homepage": 14400,           # 4 hours
    "categories": 3600,          # 1 hour
    "user_preference": 600,      # 10 minutes
}
```

### Cache Invalidation

```
When admin updates:
- Country info → Invalidate "country_{code}"
- App data → Invalidate "app_list_{country}"
- Essentials → Invalidate "essentials_{country}"
Invalidation: Delete Redis key immediately
```

---

## API Performance Targets

```
Endpoint              | Target Response Time | Cached?
---------------------|----------------------|----------
/country/{code}/      | < 100ms             | Yes (1h)
/country/{code}/apps/ | < 150ms             | Yes (15m)
/auth/login/          | < 200ms             | No
/auth/social/google/  | < 500ms             | No
/itinerary/           | < 300ms             | No
/healthz/             | < 50ms              | No

### Module Descriptions

#### **auth_app: Authentication & User Management**

**Core Responsibilities**
- Handle all user authentication flows
- Manage JWT tokens with secure expiration
- Implement social OAuth (Google, Facebook)
- GDPR-compliant account deletion
- User origin country preference storage

**Key Workflows**

*Email/Password Registration*
```
User → POST /auth/registration/ →
Backend: Validate email uniqueness, hash password →
Create User record, generate JWT →
Return: access_token + refresh_token
Frontend: Store tokens, redirect to onboarding
```

*Google OAuth Login*
```
User → Click "Sign in with Google" →
Google OAuth popup → User grants permission →
Frontend gets access_token from Google →
Frontend → POST /auth/social/google/ (with access_token) →
Backend: Validate token with Google servers →
Extract email, name from token →
Auto-create User if first time →
Return: Tripbozo JWT token →
Frontend: User is now logged in
```

*Token Refresh (Automatic)*
```
Frontend: access_token expiring in 1 minute →
Frontend: POST /auth/jwt/refresh/ (with refresh_token) →
Backend: Validate refresh_token not expired →
Generate new access_token (valid 15 min) →
Return new access_token →
Frontend: Update stored token, user stays logged in
```

#### **country: Country & App Discovery**

**Core Responsibilities**
- Manage country information and app catalogs
- Provide country page with all apps + essentials
- Cache heavily for performance
- Support filtering and searching
- Track user reviews and ratings

**Key Data Models**

```
Country
├── name, code, flag, description
└── Related: apps[], phrases[], tips[], contacts[]

AppCategory
├── name, description
└── Related: apps[]

TravelApp
├── name, icon, description, rating
├── category, country
├── android_link, ios_link, website_link
├── is_sponsored, affiliate_url
├── supports_foreign_cards, works_offline
└── Related: screenshots[], reviews[]

Review
├── user_id, rating (1-5), review_text, created_at
└── Related to: TravelApp

EmergencyContact
├── country, name (e.g., "US Embassy"), phone, email, description
└── Used for: essentials endpoint

LocalPhrase
├── country, original, translation, context_note
└── Used for: essentials endpoint

UsefulTip
├── country, tip (travel advice)
└── Used for: essentials endpoint
```

**Caching Strategy**
```
/country/{code}/              → 1 hour TTL
  └─ Complete country data
    ├─ Country info
    ├─ All apps organized by category
    ├─ Emergency contacts
    ├─ Phrases & tips
    ├─ Reviews per app
    └─ Origin assistance

/country/{code}/apps/         → 15 min TTL
  └─ App list (lightweight)

/country/{code}/essentials/   → 2 hour TTL
  └─ Contacts, phrases, tips only

Cache Invalidation:
- When admin updates country → Delete country_{code}
- When admin updates app → Delete app_list_{country}
- When new review posted → Update app data cache
```

#### **itinerary: Smart Trip Planning**

**Purpose**
Enables intelligent app recommendations based on trip structure (beach/mountain/city stops).

**Key Models**

```
Itinerary
├── user (OneToOne)
├── name, created_at
└── Related: stops[]

Stop
├── itinerary (FK)
├── name, stop_type, order
└── stop_type choices: beach, mountain, city, desert, ski

LegSuggestionRule
├── stop_type (unique)
├── categories (M2M AppCategory)
└── Example: "mountain" → [Navigation, Photography, Emergency]
```

**Smart Recommendation Algorithm**

```
User creates itinerary with stops:
1. Los Angeles (city)
2. Yosemite (mountain)
3. Lake Tahoe (ski)

For each stop:
  1. Look up LegSuggestionRule(stop_type)
  2. Get associated categories
  3. Fetch TravelApps from those categories
  4. Rank by rating
  5. Filter by capabilities (offline if needed)

Result:
- City: Google Maps, Uber, Yelp, Google Translate
- Mountain: AllTrails, Maps.ME, Camera+, Emergency SOS
- Ski: Ski resort apps, weather apps, emergency services
```

#### **homepage: Marketing & Engagement**

**Purpose**
Drives user engagement through featured countries, trending destinations, and popular apps.

**Content Types**

```
Featured Countries
├── Sorted by: app_count, essential completeness
├── Shows: Top 6 curated destinations
└── Used for: Homepage hero section

Trending Destinations
├── Calculated from: Page view analytics (last 30 days)
├── Identifies: Biggest growth % month-over-month
├── Shows: Top 5 rising destinations
└── Updates: Every hour (from analytics)

Popular Apps
├── Sorted by: Average rating (highest first)
├── Shows: Top 10 globally useful apps
└── Used for: "Popular This Week" section
```

#### **healthz: Uptime Monitoring**

**Purpose**
Provides health status for uptime monitoring services.

**What Gets Checked**
```
✓ Database connectivity (PostgreSQL)
✓ Redis connectivity (Upstash)
✓ API responsiveness
✓ Component-level status reporting

Response:
{
  "status": "healthy" | "unhealthy",
  "components": {
    "database": "ok" | "failed",
    "redis": "ok" | "failed",
    "api": "ok" | "degraded"
  }
}

Overall Status = all components "ok"
```

**Integration**
- UptimeRobot calls /healthz/ every 5 minutes
- If unhealthy → Sends alert email
- Tracks uptime percentage on Render dashboard

### Services Layer Architecture

#### **cache_service.py: Caching Operations**

```python
Purpose: Centralized Redis caching logic

Functions:
├── get_cache(key: str) → Optional[data]
│   └─ Fetch from Redis, return None if expired/missing
│
├── set_cache(key: str, data: dict, ttl: int)
│   └─ Store in Redis with TTL (seconds)
│
├── delete_cache(key: str)
│   └─ Invalidate cache immediately
│
├── get_country_key(code: str) → str
│   └─ Generate consistent key: f"country_{code}"
│
├── get_app_key(country_code: str) → str
│   └─ Generate key: f"apps_{country_code}"
│
└── invalidate_country_data(country_code: str)
    └─ Delete all related caches when country updated

Usage Pattern:
1. Try get_cache("country_TH")
2. If None: Query database, set_cache(), return result
3. If exists: Return immediately
```

#### **country_service.py: Country Business Logic**

```python
Purpose: Encapsulate country-related operations

Functions:
├── get_country_with_apps(country_code: str)
│   └─ Return: Country + categories + apps + essentials
│   └─ Cached for 1 hour
│
├── get_country_essentials(country_code: str)
│   └─ Return: Emergency contacts, phrases, tips
│   └─ Cached for 2 hours
│
├── get_apps_by_country_and_category(country_code, category_name)
│   └─ Filter apps by category within country
│
├── get_app_insights(app_id: int, country_code: str)
│   └─ Return: Reviews, ratings, statistics for app
│
└── rank_apps_by_rating(apps: List) → List
    └─ Sort by rating (high to low) + review count

Usage in Views:
view → calls service → service handles caching
       → returns clean data → view returns JSON
```

#### **app_service.py: App Recommendations**

```python
Purpose: Intelligent app suggestion algorithms

Functions:
├── suggest_apps_for_leg(stop_type: str, country_code: str)
│   └─ Smart: Find LegSuggestionRule(stop_type)
│   └─ Get apps in matched categories
│   └─ Rank by rating, filter by capabilities
│
├── filter_by_offline_capability(apps: List) → List
│   └─ Return only apps with works_offline=True
│
├── filter_by_foreign_card_support(apps: List) → List
│   └─ Return only apps supporting foreign cards
│
├── get_top_rated_apps(apps: List, limit: int = 5) → List
│   └─ Return highest-rated apps
│
└── get_apps_matching_criteria(filters: dict) → List
    └─ Complex filtering: category, rating, capabilities

Example:
Mountain stop in Nepal →
1. Find LegSuggestionRule("mountain")
2. Get categories: [Navigation, Photography, Emergency]
3. Fetch apps from Nepal in these categories
4. Filter for offline-capable (critical in mountains)
5. Rank by rating → [AllTrails 4.8★, Maps.ME 4.5★, ...]
```

## Services & Integrations

### Internal Services (Backend Business Logic)

#### 1. **Country Service** (Backend)
**Purpose**: Manages all country-related data operations and caching

**Responsibilities**:
- Fetch country metadata, associated apps, and essentials data
- Implement Redis caching with 1-hour TTL for frequently accessed countries
- Optimize search functionality with full-text indexing for quick country lookups
- Aggregate app data by category for country page views
- Handle multi-language country information (future feature)

**Key Functions**:
- `get_country_with_apps(country_code)` - Fetch country + all apps, with cache
- `search_countries(query)` - Full-text search with suggestions
- `get_country_essentials(country_code)` - Fetch emergency contacts, phrases, tips
- `invalidate_country_cache(country_code)` - Clear cache on data updates

**Caching Strategy**:
```
Request → Check Redis Cache
  ├─ Cache HIT: Return cached data immediately
  └─ Cache MISS: 
      ├─ Query PostgreSQL
      ├─ Store in Redis (TTL: 1 hour)
      └─ Return data
```

#### 2. **App Recommendation Service**
**Purpose**: Intelligent app suggestions based on travel scenarios

**Business Logic**:
- Analyze itinerary stop type (beach, mountain, city, desert, ski resort)
- Map stop_type → LegSuggestionRule → Associated AppCategories
- Query all apps in those categories from the destination country
- Rank results by rating, sponsorship status, and relevance score

**Example Flow**:
```
User itinerary: "Yosemite (mountain) → San Francisco (city)"
  ↓
Stop Type: mountain
  ↓
LegSuggestionRule: mountain → [Outdoor, Maps, Weather, Communication]
  ↓
Query: TravelApp.filter(country=USA, category__in=[Outdoor, Maps, ...])
  ↓
Rank by: rating DESC, is_sponsored DESC, created_at DESC
  ↓
Return: Top 10 apps (e.g., AllTrails, Maps.me, WeatherChannel, etc.)
```

**Ranking Algorithm**:
1. **Sponsored apps first** (business logic for monetization)
2. **High ratings** (4.5+ stars get priority)
3. **Recently added** (newer apps boost visibility)
4. **Popular** (download count or review count)
5. **Relevant features** (offline support, foreign cards)

#### 3. **Cache Service**
**Purpose**: Centralized caching layer for performance optimization

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate consistent Redis keys with prefix patterns
- Implement cache invalidation strategy (TTL + event-based)
- Store user session data (auth tokens, preferences)
- Cache frequently accessed queries (countries, popular apps)

**Cache Key Patterns**:
```
country:{country_code}:apps        → All apps for country (TTL: 1hr)
country:{country_code}:essentials  → Essentials data (TTL: 2hrs)
app_list:{category}                → Apps by category (TTL: 15min)
user:{user_id}:preferences         → User settings (TTL: session)
search_results:{query}             → Search results (TTL: 30min)
```

**Cache Invalidation Events**:
- Admin adds/updates country → Invalidate all country:* keys
- Admin updates app → Invalidate app-related keys
- User changes origin preference → Invalidate user:* keys
- Redis memory full → LRU eviction (least recently used)

#### 4. **Bundle Generation Service**
**Purpose**: Create shareable app collections for travelers

**Features**:
- Combine multiple apps into a single "bundle" (e.g., "Europe Trip 2026")
- Generate unique shareable links for bundle distribution
- Create QR codes encoding bundle metadata
- Track bundle usage and sharing analytics

**Bundle Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "bundle_xyz123",
  "name": "Europe Trip Bundle",
  "created_by": "user_id",
  "apps": [5, 12, 23],  // App IDs
  "countries": ["FR", "IT", "ES"],
  "created_at": "2026-04-24T10:30:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2027-04-24T10:30:00Z",
  "qr_code": "https://..."
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Travel agent bundles apps for client trips
- Blogger creates "Southeast Asia essentials" bundle
- Family shares curated apps for group vacation

---

### External Services & Integrations

#### 1. **Google OAuth 2.0 (Authentication)**
**Purpose**: Allow users to sign in using Google accounts

**Integration Flow**:
```
Frontend                Backend              Google
  ↓                       ↓                    ↓
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
  ↓
Browser redirects to Google login
  ↓
User enters credentials
  ↓
Google returns access_token to frontend
  ↓
Frontend sends {access_token} → POST /api/auth/social/google/
  ↓
Backend validates token via Google endpoint
  ↓
If valid → Backend creates/updates user → Returns JWT
  ↓
Frontend stores JWT → Now authenticated
```

**Technical Details**:
- **OAuth Endpoint**: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth`
- **Token Validation**: `openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo`
- **User Info Extracted**: email, given_name, family_name, picture
- **Scope Requested**: openid, email, profile
- **Implementation**: django-allauth library handles OAuth flow

**Benefits**:
- No password storage needed for Google users
- Automatic user creation on first login
- Linked account support (multiple OAuth providers)
- Account recovery via email

**Configuration**:
```python
# settings.py
SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
    'google': {
        'SCOPE': ['profile', 'email'],
        'AUTH_PARAMS': {
            'access_type': 'online',
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Facebook OAuth 2.0 (Authentication)**
**Purpose**: Alternative social authentication provider

**Integration Flow**:
- Similar to Google OAuth
- Uses Facebook SDK on frontend
- Backend validates via allauth's FacebookOAuth2Adapter
- Returns JWT on successful validation

**Key Differences**:
- Facebook returns different user info structure
- Mobile SDK support better than Google for Facebook app
- Useful for geographic regions where Facebook dominates

**Integration Details**:
```python
# Backend
class FacebookLogin(SocialLoginView):
    adapter_class = FacebookOAuth2Adapter
    callback_url = "https://tripbozo.vercel.app/login"
    serializer_class = SocialLoginSerializer
```

**Affiliate Benefit**:
- Facebook audience data can inform marketing campaigns
- User preferences help with app recommendations

```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Indexes on frequent queries**:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX country_code_idx ON country_country(code);
  CREATE INDEX app_country_idx ON country_travelapp(country_id);
  CREATE INDEX user_origin_idx ON auth_app_useroriginpreference(user_id);
  ```
- **Connection pooling** via Django (max 10-20 connections)
- **Read replicas** (future) for scaling read queries

**Security Measures**:
- **SSL/TLS encryption** in transit
- **IP whitelisting** (only Render backend IPs)
- **No password exposure** in code (env vars only)
- **Backup encryption** (encrypted at rest)
- **Regular security audits** (Aiven's responsibility)

**Disaster Recovery**:
- **PITR (Point-in-time recovery)**: Restore to any point in last 30 days
- **Backup retention**: 30 days of daily backups
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: < 1 hour
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: < 1 minute

#### Redis Cache (Upstash)
**Purpose**: High-speed in-memory caching layer for performance

**Hosting**: Upstash (serverless Redis REST API)

**Primary Use Cases**:

1. **Session Caching**
   - Store user auth tokens temporarily
   - TTL: duration of user session (~8 hours)
   - Fast authentication checks without DB query

2. **Country Data Cache**
   - Cache country + apps data after first request
   - TTL: 1 hour (refresh hourly)
   - Typical hit rate: 80%+

3. **Search Results Cache**
   - Cache country search results
   - TTL: 30 minutes
   - Saves repeated full-text search queries

4. **Essentials Cache**
   - Cache country essentials (emergency contacts, phrases)
   - TTL: 2 hours
   - Infrequently changing data

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Track login attempts per IP
   - Track API calls per user
   - Implement DDoS protection

**Cache Configuration**:
```python
# settings.py
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': os.getenv('REDIS_URL'),
        'OPTIONS': {
            'CLIENT_CLASS': 'django_redis.client.DefaultClient',
            'CONNECTION_POOL_KWARGS': {'max_connections': 50}
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Pattern Examples**:
```
country:US:data              → Full country page data
country:US:apps             → All US apps
country:US:essentials       → Emergency contacts, phrases
search:london               → Search results for "london"
user:123:prefs              → User preferences
auth:email@example.com      → Auth token cache
rate_limit:192.168.1.1:api  → Rate limit counter
```

**Memory Management**:
- **Max Memory**: 100MB (Upstash paid plan)
- **Eviction Policy**: LRU (least recently used)
- **Monitoring**: Upstash dashboard shows memory usage
- **Scaling**: Auto-scale plan if memory exceeded

**Performance Impact**:
- **With cache**: 50ms average response time
- **Without cache**: 500ms average response time
- **Improvement**: 10x faster for cached queries

ALLOWED_HOSTS=tripbozo.onrender.com,localhost,127.0.0.1

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require

# Cache
REDIS_URL=redis://:password@host:port
REDIS_URL_PER_LISTS=(optional, separate Redis instance)
REDIS_URL_ONE=(optional, third Redis instance)

# OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxx
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=xxxxx
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=xxxxx

# Email (Future)
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
# Change to: sendgrid, mailgun, or AWS SES for production

# CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tripbozo.vercel.app,https://tripbozo.com,http://localhost:3000

# Celery (Optional)
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://...
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://...
```

**Deployment Workflow**:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub `main` branch
2. Render detects push (GitHub integration enabled)
3. Render pulls latest code
4. Render runs build script:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```
5. Render restarts Gunicorn server with new code
6. Health checks verify API responsiveness
7. If health checks pass → deployment complete
8. If health checks fail → rollback to previous version

**Build & Deploy Time**: ~2-3 minutes

**Server Process**:
```bash
# Render starts the web service with:
gunicorn \
  django_admin.wsgi:application \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \
  --workers 2 \
  --timeout 30 \
  --access-logfile - \
  --error-logfile -
```

**Scaling Considerations**:
- **Current**: 1 dyno (512MB) handles ~100 concurrent users
- **Growth Path**:
  - 500 users → 2 dynos (Standard)
  - 5000 users → 3-4 Standard dynos + load balancing
  - 50k+ users → Horizontal scaling + read replicas

**Monitoring on Render**:
- Real-time logs accessible via dashboard
- HTTP request logs (method, path, status, response time)
- Crash detection and auto-restart
- Memory usage monitoring

**Cost**:
- **Free tier**: Limited dyno hours per month
- **Starter**: $7/month (512MB, shared CPU)
- **Standard**: $12-50/month (2GB+, dedicated CPU)
- **Current estimated cost**: $7-12/month

## Security Implementation

### Current Security Measures (Implemented)

#### 1. **Production Configuration Security**

**DEBUG Mode Disabled**
- **Setting**: `DEBUG = False` in production
- **Purpose**: Prevents exposure of sensitive information
- **What it prevents**:
  - SQL query logging in error pages
  - File system paths disclosure
  - Environment variables in stack traces
  - Detailed error messages to attackers
- **Impact**: Reduces information disclosure severity from CRITICAL to LOW

**ALLOWED_HOSTS Restriction**
- **Setting**: `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['tripbozo.onrender.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']`
- **Purpose**: Prevent Host Header Injection attacks
- **How it works**: Django rejects requests with unknown Host headers
- **Attacker scenario prevented**:
  ```
  Attacker sends: GET / HTTP/1.1
                  Host: attacker.com
  Result: Django responds with 400 Bad Request
  ```
- **Impact**: Prevents cache poisoning, email validation bypasses

**Secret Key Management**
- **Where stored**: Environment variable (never in code)
- **Length**: 50+ random characters
- **Rotation**: Should rotate every 6-12 months
- **Used for**: CSRF token generation, session signing, password reset tokens

---

#### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Library**: SimpleJWT
- **Token Types**:
  ```
  Access Token: 15-minute expiration
  ├─ Used for API requests
  ├─ Short-lived (prevents token theft impact)
  └─ Refreshed via refresh token
  
  Refresh Token: 7-day expiration
  ├─ Used to obtain new access tokens
  ├─ Longer-lived (stay logged in longer)
  └─ Can be rotated/revoked
  ```
- **Token Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "exp": 1234567890,
    "iat": 1234567200,
    "token_type": "access"
  }
  ```

**Password Hashing**
- **Algorithm**: PBKDF2-SHA256 (Django default)
- **Iterations**: 600,000+ (depends on Django version)
- **Salt**: Randomly generated per password
- **Strength**: Infeasible to crack with current hardware
- **Upgrade path**: Can upgrade to bcrypt/Argon2 if needed

**Social OAuth Security**
- **Google OAuth**:
  ```
  ├─ Token validation: Query Google's userinfo endpoint
  ├─ Prevents**: Fake tokens, token theft
  ├─ Flow**: Client-side auth → Backend validation
  └─ User data verified from authoritative source
  ```
- **Facebook OAuth**: Similar validation via allauth
- **Account linking**: Multiple OAuth providers per user
- **No password exposure**: Credentials never sent to backend

**Session Management**
- **Session storage**: Redis (in-memory, secure)
- **CSRF tokens**: Included in all state-changing requests
- **HttpOnly cookies**: (if used) Not accessible via JavaScript
- **SameSite policy**: Prevents cross-site request forgery

---

#### 3. **Database Security**

**SSL/TLS Connection**
- **Enforcement**: `sslmode=require` (no unencrypted connections)
- **Certificate validation**: Enabled (prevents MITM attacks)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 in transit
- **Result**: Data encrypted between app and database

**IP Whitelisting**
- **Aiven PostgreSQL**: Only allow traffic from Render backend IP
- **Effect**: Database not accessible from internet
- **Prevents**: Direct database access by attackers

**Credentials Management**
- **Storage**: Environment variables only (not in code)
- **Access**: Limited to Render environment
- **Rotation**: Database user passwords reviewed quarterly
- **Audit logging**: Connection attempts logged by Aiven

**Data Minimization**
- **Stored data**: Only what's necessary
- **User data**: Email, name, origin country (minimal)
- **No sensitive fields**: PII stored minimally, encrypted if needed
- **Deletion**: Account deletion removes all user data

---

#### 4. **API Security**

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
      'https://tripbozo.vercel.app',
      'https://tripbozo.com',
      'http://localhost:3000',  # dev only
  ]
  ```
- **Purpose**: Only allow requests from trusted domains
- **Prevents**: Cross-site request forgery from untrusted sites
- **Preflight**: Browser sends OPTIONS request first

**Rate Limiting** (Recommended, not yet implemented)
- **Purpose**: Prevent brute force attacks, DDoS
- **Strategy**:
  ```
  /api/auth/login/: 5 attempts per hour per IP
  /api/auth/registration/: 3 attempts per hour per IP
  /api/country/search/: 100 requests per hour per user
  /api/*: 1000 requests per hour per IP (default)
  ```

**API Authentication**
- **Method**: Bearer token in Authorization header
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```
- **Validation**: Token signature verified with SECRET_KEY
- **Tamper detection**: Invalid/modified tokens rejected
- **Expiration**: Expired tokens require refresh

---

### Recommended Security Improvements

#### High Priority (Production-Critical)

##### 1. **Email Backend Configuration**
**Current Issue**: Using console.EmailBackend (prints to logs, not sent)
**Problem**: Password reset, email verification can't work

**Solution Options**:

**Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)**
```python
# settings.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'sendgrid_backend.SendgridBackend'
SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@tripbozo.com'
```
- **Cost**: Free tier: 100 emails/day
- **Reliability**: 99.9% delivery
- **Features**: Bounce handling, unsubscribe tracking

**Option B: Mailgun**
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_mailgun.MailgunBackend'
MAILGUN_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('MAILGUN_ACCESS_KEY')
MAILGUN_SERVER_NAME = 'mail.tripbozo.com'
```
- **Cost**: Free tier: 5,000 emails/month
- **Features**: Webhook integration, detailed logs

**Option C: AWS SES**
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_ses.SESBackend'
AWS_SES_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
AWS_SES_REGION_ENDPOINT = 'email.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
```
- **Cost**: ~$0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **Features**: Integrated with AWS ecosystem

**Implementation Impact**:
- Enables password reset functionality
- Enables email verification
- Enables account notifications
- Time to implement: 1-2 hours

---

##### 2. **Rate Limiting (Brute Force Protection)**
**Current Issue**: No limit on login attempts
**Problem**: Attackers can try thousands of passwords

**Solution: django-ratelimit**
```bash
pip install django-ratelimit
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# views.py
from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='5/h', method='POST')
class LoginView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        # Login logic
        pass
```

**Rate Limit Rules**:
```
POST /api/auth/login/: 5 attempts/hour per IP
POST /api/auth/registration/: 3 attempts/hour per IP
POST /api/auth/password-reset/: 3 attempts/hour per email
GET /api/country/search/: 100 requests/hour per user
Default /api/*: 1000 requests/hour per IP
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Prevents automated scraping
- Protects against DDoS
- Response includes `Retry-After` header

**Time to implement**: 2-3 hours

---

##### 3. **CSRF Protection Configuration**
**Current Status**: Django has CSRF protection, but needs frontend integration

**Configuration**:
```python
# settings.py
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    'https://tripbozo.vercel.app',
    'https://tripbozo.com',
]
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # HTTPS only
CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False  # JavaScript needs to read for XHR
CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'  # Cross-site policy
```

**Frontend Integration** (Next.js):
```javascript
// api.js - Add CSRF token to requests
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
});

apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const csrfToken = document.querySelector('[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken']?.value;
  if (csrfToken) {
    config.headers['X-CSRFToken'] = csrfToken;
  }
  return config;
});
```

**Time to implement**: 1-2 hours

---

##### 4. **Security Headers**
**Purpose**: Instruct browsers on security policies

**Implementation**:
```python
# settings.py
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # 1 year
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True  # Force HTTPS

# Content Security Policy
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net')
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net')
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'", 'data:', 'https:')
CSP_FONT_SRC = ("'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com')

# Additional headers
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'
SECURE_CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {...}
```

**Headers Sent**:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...
```

**Benefits**:
- XSS attack mitigation
- Clickjacking prevention
- MIME type sniffing prevention
- Enforces HTTPS

**Time to implement**: 1-2 hours

---

##### 5. **Account Lockout After Failed Attempts**
**Purpose**: Lock account after multiple failed login attempts

**Solution: django-axes**
```bash
pip install django-axes
```

**Configuration**:
```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [..., 'axes', ...]

AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 5  # Lock after 5 failures
AXES_COOLOFF_DURATION = timedelta(minutes=30)  # 30 min lockout
AXES_LOCK_OUT_AT_FAILURE = True
AXES_USE_USER_AGENT = True  # Consider user agent
AXES_LOCKOUT_TEMPLATE = 'accounts/lockout.html'
```

**Behavior**:
```
Attempt 1-4: Rejected, counter incremented
  ↓
Attempt 5: Account locked for 30 minutes
  ↓
After 30 min: Counter reset, can attempt again
  ↓
Success: Counter reset to 0
```

**Time to implement**: 2-3 hours

---

#### Medium Priority (Important for Compliance)

##### 1. **Audit Logging**
**Purpose**: Track security-relevant events

**Events to Log**:
- User registration (email, IP, timestamp)
- Login attempts (success/failure, IP, timestamp)
- Password changes (user ID, timestamp)
- Account deletions (user ID, IP, timestamp)
- Admin actions (add/edit/delete, user ID, timestamp)
- API key usage (if implemented)
- Permission changes

**Implementation**:
```python
# models.py
class AuditLog(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True)
    event_type = models.CharField(choices=[...])
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    details = models.JSONField()
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-timestamp']
```

**Time to implement**: 4-6 hours
**Compliance benefit**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 audit trails

---

##### 2. **Input Validation Enhancements**
**Current**: Basic Django model validation

**Improvements**:
```python
# Stricter validators
from django.core.validators import EmailValidator, URLValidator

class TravelApp(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(
        max_length=255,
        validators=[MinLengthValidator(3)]
    )
    email = models.EmailField(
        validators=[EmailValidator(allowlist=['email.com', ...])]
    )
    icon_url = models.URLField(
        validators=[URLValidator(schemes=['https'])]  # HTTPS only
    )
    
    def clean(self):
        # Custom validation
        if self.android_link and 'play.google.com' not in self.android_link:
            raise ValidationError("Android link must be Google Play")
```

**Time to implement**: 3-4 hours
**Impact**: Prevent malicious/malformed data entry

---

##### 3. **API Versioning**
**Purpose**: Maintain backward compatibility as API evolves

**Implementation**:
```python
# urls.py
from rest_framework import routers

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/v1/', include('api.v1.urls')),
    path('api/v2/', include('api.v2.urls')),  # future version
]
```

**Benefits**:
- Old clients continue working
- New clients can use improved endpoints
- Gradual migration path

---

##### 4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
**Purpose**: Additional security for sensitive accounts

**Implementation Options**:
- TOTP (Time-based OTP) - Google Authenticator, Authy
- SMS-based OTP
- Email-based OTP

**Library**: `django-otp`

**Time to implement**: 8-10 hours
**Compliance benefit**: GDPR, PCI-DSS
